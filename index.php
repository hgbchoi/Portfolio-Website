          <h1>I aspire to become a full stack developer who knows how to tackle challenging problems and writes efficient code that everyone can understand.</h1>
          <h2 class = "is-bolder">Who Am I?</h2>
          <h2>I am a systems engineering student attending Simon Fraser University and graduating in Summer 2018. Throughout my studies I learned how to collaborate with teammates, breakdown complex problems into manageable pieces, and persevere through difficult problems and situations.
          I am constantly learning each day, developing my skills to reach my goal.</h2>
          <h2 class = "is-bolder">What Do I Like About Software Development?</h2>
          <h2>The idea of creating something useful that can be enjoyed by anyone across the globe with just a computer is absolutely compelling to me. Throughout my internship as a quality assurance analyst, I gained first hand experience of the agile software development life cycle. The challenges that developers faced in the company each day were those that I thought I would love to be able to solve someday and this motivated me to start learning the neccessary technologies.

      <h1>I'm Learning..</h1>
        <p>Since now that I have a basic working knowledge of the main languages used for front-end web development, I am currently focused on learning some of the server side languages such as <span class = "is-bold">PHP</span> and some of the database related techonologies such as <span class ="is-bold">MongoDB + MySQL Server</span>.
        <p>In order to gain familiarity with the technologies that are widely used in the market, I am also studying the Javascript library, <span class = "is-bold">React</span>.</p>
        <p>I am also constantly learning new things about the technologies listed in the <span class = "is-bold">'I Know...'</span> section through working on new projects such as this portfolio site!</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "skills-flexbox">
      <h1>I Want to Learn..</h1>
        <p>Through the enormous advancements in technologies used in development and their capabilities, there are near endless things that I want to learn. One of the most interesting fields for me is <span class = "is-bold">machine learning</span> because the field is growing very rapidly and finding a lot of use cases.</p>
        <p>On the programming language side, I never had the opportunity to incorporate <span class = "is-bold"> Python</span> into my project and I want to be able to do so since it has a reputation of being a very versatile language.</p>
        <p>Finally, I would like to learn how to develop my own assets with tools such as <span class = "is-bold">Photoshop</span>, to use in future projects for the ability to customize them just the way I like!</p>

The game has a huge entrance barrier which discourages newer players from continuing on, and this app was designed to help them get over the hurdle. This was one of my first Android projects and is available on the Play Store!</p>
